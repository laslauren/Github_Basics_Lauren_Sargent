My Repository: https://github.com/laslauren/Github_Basics_Lauren_Sargent
I learned about the workspace of GitHub and the basics. I understand the basics of everything, and just need more experience with the interface itself to familiarize myself with it.
I am sure as I progress in my usage I will come across features I do not understand, but for now everything I have seen I understand.
